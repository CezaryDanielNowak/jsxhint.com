# Welcome to JSXHint.com

This is fork of [valueof/jshint.com](https://github.com/valueof/jshint.com), and all
honors should go to original author.
JSXHint.com is working exacly the same, but allows to check react-JSX code without obvious errors
caused by html-like syntax in JS code.

Feel free to fork and contribute!
