# Commercial Support

JSHint is an open source project and it will always stay this way. It is
developed and maintained by me, [Anton Kovalyov](http://anton.kovalyov.net/),
in my spare time. If your company is getting value out of JSHint, consider
supporting the project: it will enable me to spend more time improving JSHint.

There are two main ways to support the project. You can donate either with
[PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=L9V4YWVEMSQLY) or 
with [GitTip](https://www.gittip.com/antonkovalyov). Alternatively, you
can purchase a commercial support package.

Commercial support package is targeted mostly at organizations who are
getting value out of JSHint and would like to sponsor its development. It
costs $500 per month and you get a guarantee that I'll look into your bug
reports within two workdays and prioritize them over other non-critical bugs.

If you'd like to purchase commercial support package, feel free to reach
out to me at [anton@kovalyov.net](mailto:anton@kovalyov.net)
